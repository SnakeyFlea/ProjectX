## 🎮 About the Project

**Project X** is a passion project aiming to recreate the unforgettable experience of **Fortnite Season X** — the rift zones, the BRUTEs, the OG map, and the glitchy madness — using the power of **Unreal Engine 5.5**.

We're rebuilding the map, UI, gameplay mechanics, and core systems from the ground up to capture the *exact* feel of Chapter 1's final season — with a modern engine twist.
